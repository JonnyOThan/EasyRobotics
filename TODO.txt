- reselect last selected servo upon servo chain update
- doesn't move when target/effector orientation has changed, only position is checked
- Orientation tracking doesn't track orientation, just direction, leaving a free rotation
  Actually, maybe there should be 3 modes, Position, Pos+Direction, Pos+Orientation
- implement testing iteratively all IK solutions, testing 3 angles on each servo
