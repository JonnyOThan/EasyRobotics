# KSP Community Fixes

This plugin is a collection of code patches for fixing bugs and performance issues in the KSP codebase, and adding small QoL improvements. Entirely new features (especially those already covered by other mods) are out of scope, as well as patches that might alter the stock behaviors to minimize potential mod compatibility issues.

This mod is meant as community project, so feel free to propose additional patch ideas by opening an issue, or to contribute with a pull request.

#### Major bugfixes

- **RefundingOnRecovery** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Vessel recovery funds properly account for modules implementing IPartCostModifier. This bug affect stock fairings, cargo parts and many modules from various mods (part switchers and procedural parts mods, USI, Kerbalism, Tweakscale, etc).
- **KerbalInventoryPersistence** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix the whole kerbal inventory persistence system being inactive in KSP 1.12.2+. This cause multiple issues, like being able to bypass kerbal inventories mass/volume limits, and various cargo part duplication / disappearance issues when EVAing / boarding.
- **[RoboticsDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/13)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Prevent unrecoverable part position drift of Breaking Grounds DLC robotic parts and their children parts.
- **DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes** [KSP 1.12.3]<br/>Make the stock docking port rotation feature actually useable :
  - Completely prevent unrecoverable position drift of children parts of docking ports.
  - Fix joint failure and phantom forces when a docking port pair is set to opposite extreme angles.
  - Allow tweaking the rotation in the editor and while not docked in flight.
  - Rotation can now be properly used in a robotic controller.
  - Remove the -86°/86° hardcoded limitation of `hardMinMaxLimits`, it is now -180°/180°.
  - Fix many issues and state inconsistencies.
  - An optional `DockingPortExtendedRotation.cfg.extra` MM patch extending rotation range to 360° is available in the `Extras` folder. Copy it to your `GameData` folder and remove the `.extra` extension to use it.
- **[AutoStrutDrift](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/21)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Improves the overall physics stability when using autostruts and prevent autostrut induced deformations following vessel modification events (decoupling, docking/undocking, fairing separation...).
- **ModuleIndexingMismatch** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Prevent modules persisted state from being lost in existing saves/ships following a mod installation/uninstallation/update. Note that this won't handle all cases, but it massively reduce occurrences of that issue.
- **PackedPartsRotation** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix part rotations not being reset to their pristine value when a non-landed vessel is packed, resulting in permanent part rotation drift when docking and other minor/cosmetic issues.
- **[PartStartStability](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/9)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix vessel deformation and kraken events on flight scene load, also prevent some kraken issues when placing parts with EVA construction.

#### Minor bugfixes
- **PAWGroupMemory** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix the expanded/retracted state of Part Action Window groups being reset when the PAW is closed or internally rebuilt (especially frequent in the editor).
- **PAWItemsOrder** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix PAW items position randomly changing and flickering.
- **KerbalTooltipMaxSustainedG** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix the kerbals tooltip giving wrong "Max sustainable G" information.
- **ROCValidationOOR** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix ROCManager crashing during loading with Kopernicus modified systems.
- **ReactionWheelsPotentialTorque** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix reaction wheels reporting incorrect available torque when "Wheel Authority" is set below 100%. Fix stock SAS (and possibly other attitude controllers) instability issues.
- **StockAlarmCustomFormatterDate** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Make the stock alarm respect the day/year length defined by mods like Kronometer. Fix the underlying AppUIMemberDateTime UI widget API to use the mod-provided IDateTimeFormatter if present.
- **ExtendedDeployableParts** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Fix deployable parts (antennas, solar panels, radiators...) always starting in the extended state when the model isn't exported in the retracted state. This bug affect parts from various mods (ex : Ven's stock revamp solar panels).

#### Quality of Life tweaks 

- **PAWCollapsedInventories** [KSP 1.11.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Part Action Window inventory UI widgets in a collapsed group by default, group title show volume and mass usage. Applied to part and kerbal inventories.<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/PAWCollapsedInventories.gif" width="300"/>
- **AltimeterHorizontalPosition** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Altimeter widget horizontal position is now tweakable in the pause menu settings.<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/AltimeterHorizontalPosition.gif" width="500"/>
- **PAWStockGroups** [KSP 1.10.1 - 1.12.3]<br/>Part Action Window groups for a selection of stock items/modules<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/PAWGroups.png" width="500"/>
- **[TweakableWheelsAutostrut](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/16)** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Allow tweaking the autostrut mode of wheels/landing legs. Still default to "Heaviest part".<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/TweakableWheelsAutostrut.gif"/>
- **UIFloatEditNumericInput** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Allow numeric input ("#" button) in "float edit" PAW items<br/><img src="https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/raw/master/Screenshots/UIFloatEditNumericInput.gif"/>
- **DisableManeuverTool** [KSP 1.12.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Allow disabling the stock maneuver tool in the in-game settings menu (it can cause severe lag/stutter, especially with Kopernicus modified systems)
- **FairingMouseOverPersistence** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Make the "Fairing Expansion" state persistent when reloading a craft in the editor.
- **HidePartUpgradeExtendedInfo** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Hides irrelevant extended info on the part tooltip for PartUpgrades in the RnD screen.

#### Performance tweaks 

- **SceneLoadSpeedBoost** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Reduce scene switches loading time with large/modded saves by caching the current save in memory instead of loading it from disk.
- **OnDemandPartBuoyancy** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Prevent the part buoyancy integrator from running when not needed. Improves performance for large part count vessels while in the SOI of a body that has an ocean (Kerbin, Eve, Laythe...)
- **TextureLoaderOptimizations** [KSP 1.10.0 - 1.12.3]<br/> Speedup loading time by caching on disk the PNG textures KSP converts to DXT5 on every launch. Also make PNG `@thumbs` cargo part textures non-readable to free some RAM. This patch has no entry in `settings.cfg`, but is opt-in (a popup is shown on first KSP launch) and can be disabled latter in the in-game settings menu.

#### API and modding tools
- **MultipleModuleInPartAPI** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>This API allow other plugins to implement PartModules that can exist in multiple occurrence in a single part and won't suffer "module indexing mismatch" persistent data losses following part configuration changes. [See documentation on the wiki](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/wiki/MultipleModuleInPartAPI).
- **DockingPortLockedEvents** [KSP 1.12.2 - 1.12.3]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Fire GameEvents onRoboticPartLockChanging/onRoboticPartLockChanged respectively before/after calls to ModuleDockingNode.ModifyLocked(), following a modification of the ModuleDockingNode.nodeIsLocked field.
- **OnSymmetryFieldChanged** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/> Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Change the `UI_Control.onSymmetryFieldChanged` callback to behave identically to the `UI_Control.onFieldChanged` callback :
  - The callback will only be called when the field value has actually been modified.
  - The "object" argument will contain the previous field value (instead of the new value).
- **PersistentIConfigNode** [KSP 1.8.0 - 1.12.3]<br/>Disabled by default, you can enable it with a MM patch. Implement `IConfigNode` members marked as `[Persistent]` serialization support when using the `CreateObjectFromConfig()`, `LoadObjectFromConfig()` and `CreateConfigFromObject()` methods.

### Changelog

##### 1.11.0
- New bugfix : ExtendedDeployableParts
- New performance tweak : TextureLoaderOptimizations
- new Qol tweak : HidePartUpgradeExtendedInfo, courtesy of @NathanKell (see [PR#29](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/pull/29))

##### 1.10.1
DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes refinements :
- Fixed the stock implementation being unable to handle a rotating docking ports when it is the root part (was throwing exceptions and generally wasn't working correctly)
- Fixed another stock bug : having a `rotationAxis` other than "Y" result in the docking port still rotating around the Y axis. This bug affect the 2 "inline" stock docking port parts.
- Fixed KSPCF bug : parent port not being able to rotate after re-docking
- Fixed KSPCF bug : things were not working as expected when using a rotating + non-rotating docking port pair
- Fixed KSPCF bug : prevent rotation being available when about to dock or after undocking when the other docking port is "acquired" but not docked.
- Various performance optimizations

##### 1.10.0
- New bugfix : DockingPortRotationDriftAndFixes. This patch contain several docking port fixes, and supersede the DockingPortLocking and DockingPortDrift patches, those patches have been removed.
- New bugfix : PackedPartsRotation. This patch is a generalization of a fix previously implemented in RoboticsDrift, and now cover all occurrences of that issue.
- New QoL patch : FairingMouseOverPersistence (suggested by forum user @dok_377)
- New mod API optional patch : OnSymmetryFieldChanged (thanks to @DRVeyl)
- New mod API optional patch : PersistentIConfigNode (thanks to @NathanKell)
- PartStartStability : fixed the patch causing an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` on scene/vessel load in `FlightIntegrator.Update()`. As a side effect, this patch now make the FI first "valid" execution deterministic (will always be on the fourth `FixedUpdate()` cycle).
- RoboticsDrift : fixed incorrect handling when a robotic part is the vessel root part
- Prevent some patches failing with a `ReflectionTypeLoadException` when another plugin assembly fail to load (ex : the Sandcastle/EL integration assembly)

##### 1.9.1
- RoboticsDrift : fixed (harmless) `[RoboticsDrift] Servo info not found...` log spam when toggling the locked state of a robotic part in the editor

##### 1.9.0
- New bugfix : RoboticsDrift, see [issue #13](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/13).
- New mod API patch : DockingPortLockedEvents (added for KJR, see [related issue](https://github.com/KSP-RO/Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-Continued/issues/9))
- New bugfix : DockingPortLocking
- PAWCollapsedInventories : Fixed mass/volume info not updating correctly in the group title.
- Now using [Krafs.Publicizer](https://github.com/krafs/Publicizer) for cleaner/faster access to KSP internals. 

##### 1.8.0
- New bugfix : AutoStrutDrift, see [issue #21](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/21). Thanks to @Lisias for [investigation efforts](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSP-Recall/issues/27#issuecomment-1022167916).
- New bugfix : PartStartStability, see [issue #9](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/KSPCommunityFixes/issues/9).
- The FlightSceneLoadKraken patch is superseded by the PartStartStability patch, which is now disabled by default
- Fixed a silly mistake with the OnDemandPartBuoyancy patch where it would prevent part buoyancy from running if the vessel is already below water at scene load. Thanks to @DRVeyl for catching that.

##### 1.7.0
- New performance patch : OnDemandPartBuoyancy (thanks to @siimav)
- New bugfix : ROCValidationOOR (thanks to @R-T-B)

##### 1.6.1
- Fixed version file for 1.12.3

##### 1.6.0

##### 1.5.0
- New bugfix : KerbalTooltipMaxSustainedG
- Fixed (again...) some patches not being applied

##### 1.4.2
- Fixed ModuleIndexingMismatch patch causing issues with modules dynamically adding/removing resources. Specifically, the patch was causing part resources to be loaded before (instead of after in stock) the `PartModule.OnLoad()` call when loading a `ShipConstruct`. This notably fixes RealFuel resources being lost when reloading/launching a craft file, but that mistake likely had consequences for other fuel/resource switchers mods (B9PS, Firespitter...)
