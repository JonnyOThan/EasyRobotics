### Overview

EasyRobotics is an *Inverse Kinematics* (IK) controller for the Breaking Grounds DLC rotation and hinge servo parts. It allow to setup an *IK chain* made of several servos and an *effector*. The controller adjust the servos target angle automatically so the *effector* match a specific position and/or rotation in space, which can be either manually defined, or automatically set from a *target* part.

EasyRobotics is available from the *Part Action Window* for the *KAL-1000* part, as well as any modded part featuring the stock robotic controller.

### IK Configuration

EasyRobotics requires you to select an effector part, and at least one servo.
